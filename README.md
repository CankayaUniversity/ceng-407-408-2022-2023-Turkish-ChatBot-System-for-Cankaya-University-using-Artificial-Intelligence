Turkish ChatBot System for Cankaya University using Artificial Intelligence

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent in our daily lives, and as a result, there has been a significant increase in the study of AI. One area where AI has been applied is in the development of chatbots, which are AI-powered programs that use natural language processing to enable users to interact with them and access information. Chatbots are used in a variety of industries, such as healthcare, marketing, customer service, and sales, to help businesses save time and money by automating tasks and providing quick access to information.

In this project, we aim to create a chatbot for Çankaya University that will provide users with information about the university's departments, staff, campus transportation, internship reports, courses, scholarship opportunities, and registration fees. The chatbot will be trained on data taken from the university's website, which will be used to create a database of frequently asked questions and answers in Turkish. This will allow the chatbot to understand and respond to user inquiries in real-time.

Our goal is to provide users with quick and easy access to information about the university and to offer consultation services. By implementing a chatbot, we aim to improve the user experience and make it easier for people to find the information they need about Çankaya University. Additionally, the chatbot will help to reduce the workload of university staff by automating many common tasks, freeing up time for more important tasks. We believe that our chatbot will be a valuable addition to the university and will help to improve the overall experience of students, staff, and other users.
